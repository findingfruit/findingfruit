Howdy! Iâ€™m @findingfruit. Thanks for stopping by.
I'm a senior civil engineering student at UT Austin planning to pursue a MS in transportation engineering, 
specifically in the area of of intelligent infrastructure networks.

I have some surface level experience with programming, and I am currently learning python as a substitute for excel.
Matplotlib and pandas are what I am working with at the moment. 

Some fun stuff: I enjoy playing basketball, chess, and reading science fiction.
